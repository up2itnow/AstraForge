# Feature Specification: True Multi-LLM Collaboration System

**Feature Branch**: `feature/002-true-multi-llm-collaboration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement true multi-LLM collaboration that achieves meaningful collaboration rather than sequential task handoffs, with time-limited debates, intelligent task assignment, and high-quality outputs."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an AstraForge user, I want multiple LLMs to collaborate meaningfully on my development tasks so that I receive more comprehensive, innovative, and higher-quality solutions than any single LLM could provide alone.

**Example Flow:**
1. User requests "Create a secure user authentication system"
2. System initiates collaborative session with 3 LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok)
3. LLMs engage in structured debate about architecture approaches
4. After 3 minutes, they reach consensus on hybrid approach combining their best ideas
5. Task assignment: OpenAI handles implementation, Anthropic handles security review, Grok handles innovative UX features
6. Final output is synthesized from all contributions with measurably superior quality

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Collaborative Architecture Design
**Given** a complex feature request requiring architectural decisions  
**When** the multi-LLM collaboration system is invoked  
**Then** multiple LLMs should:
- Propose different architectural approaches within 60 seconds
- Engage in structured debate for 2-3 minutes maximum
- Reach consensus through voting or synthesis
- Produce an architecture document that combines the best elements from all proposals
- Demonstrate measurably better quality than single-LLM output

#### Scenario 2: Time-Bounded Debate Resolution  
**Given** LLMs are debating implementation approaches  
**When** the 3-minute time limit is reached  
**Then** the system should:
- Force consensus through majority voting if no agreement reached
- Document minority opinions for future reference
- Proceed with task assignment based on agreed approach
- Log debate metrics for system optimization

#### Scenario 3: Intelligent Task Assignment
**Given** a collaborative plan has been agreed upon  
**When** implementation tasks need to be assigned  
**Then** the system should:
- Analyze each LLM's demonstrated strengths
- Assign tasks based on optimal LLM capabilities (e.g., OpenAI for implementation, Anthropic for logic/security, Grok for innovation)
- Avoid duplicate work unless voting on alternatives is specifically needed
- Optimize for both quality and cost-effectiveness

### Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: LLM Provider Unavailability
**Given** one or more LLM providers are unavailable during collaboration  
**When** the collaboration session is initiated  
**Then** the system should gracefully degrade to available providers while maintaining collaboration patterns

#### Edge Case 2: Infinite Debate Loop Prevention
**Given** LLMs cannot reach consensus within time limits  
**When** multiple rounds of debate occur  
**Then** the system should implement progressive consensus mechanisms (simple majority → qualified majority → admin override)

#### Edge Case 3: Token Budget Exhaustion
**Given** collaboration is consuming excessive tokens  
**When** budget limits are approached  
**Then** the system should prioritize critical decisions and summarize less critical debates

## Clarifications Needed

1. **Consensus Threshold**: What percentage agreement constitutes consensus? (Suggested: 66% for major decisions, 51% for minor ones)

2. **LLM Strength Profiling**: How should the system initially determine each LLM's strengths before historical data is available? (Suggested: Predefined profiles based on known capabilities)

3. **Quality Metrics**: What specific metrics will determine if collaborative output is "measurably better" than single-LLM output? (Suggested: Code quality scores, test coverage, documentation completeness, user satisfaction)

4. **Fallback Strategies**: What happens when collaboration fails to produce better results than single-LLM approach? (Suggested: Automatic fallback with learning integration)

5. **Integration Points**: How does this system integrate with existing AstraForge workflows and the Spec-Kit process? (Suggested: Replace current conference() calls with new collaborative workflows)

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Planning phase to design technical architecture and implementation approach.
