## R001: VS Code Git API Integration Patterns

**Rationale**: Need to hook into file change detection and Git workflow for seamless code review integration

**Alternatives Considered**: File system watchers, manual triggers, Git hooks

**Decision**: Use VS Code's Git extension API with `vscode.git` extension integration

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Use `vscode.extensions.getExtension('vscode.git')` to access Git API
- Listen to `onDidChangeRepository` events for file changes
- Integrate with `SourceControl` API for diff viewing
- Leverage existing GitManager in AstraForge for consistency

## R002: LLM Prompt Engineering for Code Analysis  

**Rationale**: Different LLMs excel at different types of code analysis, need optimal prompt strategies

**Alternatives Considered**: Single model approach, ensemble methods, specialized prompts per model

**Decision**: Multi-prompt strategy leveraging model-specific strengths

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Bug detection, logical error identification, edge case analysis
- **Anthropic Claude**: Architectural suggestions, code organization, maintainability
- **xAI Grok**: Performance optimization, resource usage, algorithmic efficiency
- **Prompt Templates**: Standardized formats for consistency across models
- **Context Window Management**: Chunk large files appropriately for each model

## R003: Code Quality Metrics and Industry Standards

**Rationale**: Need standardized, meaningful metrics for tracking improvement over time

**Alternatives Considered**: Custom metrics, industry standards (SonarQube, CodeClimate), hybrid approach

**Decision**: Hybrid approach using established metrics enhanced with AI-generated insights

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Standard Metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, code duplication
- **AI-Enhanced Metrics**: Readability score, architectural consistency, naming quality
- **Trend Tracking**: Historical comparison, improvement velocity, regression detection
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs for metric evolution over time

## R004: VS Code Extension UI Patterns for Code Suggestions

**Rationale**: Need intuitive, non-intrusive way to display code review suggestions

**Alternatives Considered**: Sidebar panel, inline decorations, hover providers, diagnostic collections

**Decision**: Multi-modal approach for different use cases

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Diagnostics Collection**: Inline squiggly lines for immediate feedback
- **Sidebar Panel**: Detailed suggestions with explanations and examples  
- **Hover Provider**: Quick previews without disrupting workflow
- **Code Actions**: One-click fixes for applicable suggestions
- **Status Bar**: Overall quality score and review progress

## R005: Vector Database Integration for Code Context

**Rationale**: Leverage existing AstraForge vector DB for code pattern recognition and context

**Alternatives Considered**: Separate storage, file-based caching, in-memory only

**Decision**: Extend existing VectorDB with code-specific embeddings

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Code Embeddings**: Store function/class embeddings for similarity search
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring code patterns and anti-patterns
- **Context Retrieval**: Find similar code sections for consistent suggestions
- **Learning Integration**: Store successful suggestion patterns for future reference

## R006: Performance Optimization Strategies

**Rationale**: Code analysis must be fast enough for real-time developer workflow

**Alternatives Considered**: Synchronous analysis, full async, hybrid approach

**Decision**: Hybrid approach with immediate feedback and progressive enhancement

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Immediate Response**: Basic syntax and style checks within 500ms
- **Progressive Analysis**: Deeper AI analysis in background with updates
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache analysis results for unchanged code sections
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize for multiple file analysis scenarios
- **Resource Management**: Respect VS Code performance guidelines
