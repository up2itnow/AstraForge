## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)  
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using AstraForge, I want an AI-powered code reviewer that automatically analyzes my code changes and provides intelligent suggestions, so that I can improve code quality, catch potential bugs early, and learn better coding practices through AI guidance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer opens a file with recent changes in VS Code, **When** they trigger the AI code review, **Then** the system analyzes the code and displays suggestions in a sidebar panel with severity levels and explanations.

2. **Given** a developer has made multiple commits to a feature branch, **When** they request a comprehensive review, **Then** the AI analyzes the entire changeset and provides a summary report with quality metrics and improvement recommendations.

3. **Given** the AI code reviewer has been used over multiple projects, **When** a developer views their dashboard, **Then** they can see historical code quality trends, most common issues, and personalized learning recommendations.

4. **Given** a team is working on the same AstraForge codebase, **When** they enable collaborative review mode, **Then** the AI learns from team patterns and provides consistent suggestions aligned with project conventions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the AI cannot analyze obfuscated or generated code?
- How does the system handle very large files or changesets that exceed token limits?
- What occurs when network connectivity is lost during analysis?
- How does the system behave with code in languages not well-supported by the LLM?
- What happens when conflicting suggestions are provided by different AI models?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate with VS Code's Git extension to automatically detect code changes and provide review triggers
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze code using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) to provide diverse perspectives on code quality
- **FR-003**: System MUST categorize suggestions by severity (Critical, Warning, Info) and type (Bug Risk, Performance, Style, Security)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide detailed explanations for each suggestion including rationale and example fixes
- **FR-005**: System MUST track code quality metrics over time including technical debt score, complexity trends, and improvement velocity
- **FR-006**: System MUST support batch analysis of multiple files or entire pull requests with summary reporting
- **FR-007**: System MUST learn from user feedback (accept/reject suggestions) to improve future recommendations
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with AstraForge's existing vector database to maintain context about project patterns and conventions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CodeReview**: Represents a single analysis session with timestamp, files analyzed, suggestions generated, and quality metrics
- **Suggestion**: Individual improvement recommendation with type, severity, description, code location, and user feedback status
- **QualityMetric**: Quantitative measures like complexity score, test coverage impact, performance indicators, and technical debt assessment
- **ReviewSession**: Container for related reviews across a feature branch or time period with aggregate statistics and trends
- **UserPreference**: Developer-specific settings for review sensitivity, preferred AI models, ignored suggestion types, and learning preferences
