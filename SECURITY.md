## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in AstraForge IDE, please report it
responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email us directly** at: security@astraforge.dev (or create a private
   security advisory on GitHub)
3. **Include details** about the vulnerability and potential impact
4. **Provide steps** to reproduce if possible

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30-90 days depending on complexity

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
- We will provide credit for responsible disclosure (unless you prefer
  anonymity)
- We will coordinate disclosure timing to protect users
- We may offer bounty rewards for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **API Key Protection**: Keys are never logged or exposed in code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD

### Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Network Transmission**: HTTPS/TLS for all API communications
- **Memory Management**: Secure cleanup of sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

### Infrastructure Security

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Secured build and deployment processes
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of environment variables
- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged
- **Regular Updates**: Prompt application of security patches

## Best Practices for Users

### API Key Security

1. **Environment Variables**: Store keys in `.env` files (never commit)
2. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
3. **Scope Limitation**: Use keys with minimal required permissions
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage for anomalies

### Safe Usage

1. **Trusted Sources**: Only install from official sources
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep the extension updated
3. **Network Security**: Use secure networks for sensitive operations
4. **Data Review**: Review generated code before execution

### Configuration Security

```bash
# .env file example (never commit this file)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-secure-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-secure-key-here

# Use strong, unique keys for each service
# Enable API key restrictions where available
# Monitor usage through provider dashboards
```

## Security Features

### Input Sanitization

The extension includes comprehensive input validation:

```typescript
// Example of built-in security measures
export function validateLLMInput(input: string): ValidationResult {
  // Remove control characters
  // Check for injection attempts
  // Validate length and content
  // Sanitize potentially dangerous patterns
}
```

### Rate Limiting

Built-in protection against abuse:

- Request throttling per provider
- Concurrent request limits
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Cache-based optimization

### Secure Defaults

- Secure configuration out of the box
- Minimal required permissions
- Safe error handling
- Automatic security updates (when available)

## Known Security Considerations

### LLM Provider Risks

- **Data Privacy**: Prompts are sent to third-party providers
- **Content Filtering**: Provider-specific content policies apply
- **Rate Limits**: Exceeding limits may cause service disruption
- **Model Limitations**: AI responses may contain inaccuracies

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Minimization**: Only send necessary context
- **Content Review**: Always review generated code
- **Provider Diversity**: Use multiple providers for redundancy
- **Local Validation**: Validate all outputs before use

### VS Code Extension Risks

- **File System Access**: Extension can read/write project files
- **Network Access**: Extension makes HTTP requests to LLM providers
- **Configuration Access**: Extension reads VS Code settings
- **Command Execution**: Extension can run VS Code commands

### User Controls

- **Permission Review**: Review extension permissions before installation
- **Settings Control**: Configure extension behavior through settings
- **Audit Logging**: Monitor extension activity through logs
- **Selective Usage**: Choose when and how to use AI features

## Compliance

### Privacy Standards

- **GDPR**: Data processing transparency and user rights
- **CCPA**: California privacy rights compliance
- **SOC 2**: Security controls for service organizations
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Industry Standards

- **OWASP**: Following web application security guidelines
- **NIST**: Cybersecurity framework alignment
- **CWE**: Common weakness enumeration awareness
- **CVE**: Common vulnerabilities and exposures tracking

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Official vulnerability announcements
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes highlighted in releases
- **Email Notifications**: Critical security updates (opt-in)
- **VS Code Marketplace**: Extension update notifications

### Update Process

1. **Automatic Updates**: VS Code can auto-update extensions
2. **Manual Updates**: Check for updates regularly
3. **Version Verification**: Verify extension version after updates
4. **Configuration Review**: Review settings after major updates
