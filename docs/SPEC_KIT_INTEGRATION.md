# Spec Kit Integration Guide

## Overview

AstraForge now integrates GitHub's Spec Kit to provide robust spec-driven development capabilities. This integration combines AstraForge's AI-powered multi-LLM collaboration with Spec Kit's structured development methodology.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) flips traditional development by making specifications executable and directly generating implementations. Instead of writing code first and documenting later, SDD ensures:

- **Specifications are comprehensive** before any code is written
- **Requirements are validated** through multi-agent collaboration
- **Test-driven development is enforced** with constitutional principles
- **Quality gates prevent** over-engineering and complexity

## Key Features

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Spec Kit

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run:
```
AstraForge: Initialize Spec Kit
```

This creates the following structure in your workspace:
```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ specs/                 # Specification documents
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/             # Spec Kit templates
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # Automation scripts
â””â”€â”€ memory/               # Constitution and guidelines
    â””â”€â”€ constitution.md   # AstraForge development principles
```

### 2. Create Your First Specification

Use the Command Palette:
```
AstraForge: Create Specification
```

Enter your project idea in natural language:
```
Build a task management system with drag-and-drop boards, 
real-time collaboration, and automated workflow management
```

### 3. Follow the Spec-Driven Workflow

AstraForge will automatically guide you through:

1. **Specification Phase**: AI generates comprehensive specs
2. **Planning Phase**: Technical implementation plan with research
3. **Task Generation**: Detailed, executable task list
4. **Implementation**: TDD-enforced development

- Dependencies: VS Code API, OpenAI API, Git integration
- Storage: Vector DB for code embeddings, File system for configs
- Testing: Jest with 85% coverage requirement

### 4. Generated Tasks
- T001: Setup project structure
- T002: [P] Contract tests for PR analysis API
- T003: [P] Contract tests for suggestion API
- T004: Implement PR analyzer service
- T005: Implement suggestion generator
- T006: Integration with VS Code Git
- T007: Performance optimization

### 5. Execution
Tasks execute in TDD order with parallel optimization, following constitutional principles.

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Ideas
- Be specific about user needs, not implementation
- Include context about the problem being solved
- Mention any constraints or requirements
- Avoid technical implementation details

**Good**: 
> "Build a meeting scheduler that automatically finds optimal times for all participants based on their calendar availability and preferences"

**Avoid**: 
> "Build a React app with a Node.js backend using MongoDB to store calendar data"

### Refining Specifications
- Review generated specs for completeness
- Add clarifications for ambiguous requirements
- Validate user scenarios match your vision
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable

### Following TDD
- Always write tests before implementation
- Ensure tests fail initially (red phase)
- Write minimal code to pass tests (green phase)
- Refactor for quality (refactor phase)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to initialize Spec Kit"**
- Ensure you have an open workspace folder
- Check that you have write permissions
- Verify Git is installed and configured

**"Specification generation failed"**
- Check your LLM API keys are configured
- Ensure internet connectivity for research tasks
- Try a more specific or detailed idea description

**"Task validation failed"**
- Review the reported issues in the validation message
- Check for file conflicts in parallel tasks
- Ensure TDD ordering is maintained

**"Constitution violations detected"**
- Review the specific violations listed
- Simplify the approach if over-engineered
- Justify complexity if truly necessary
