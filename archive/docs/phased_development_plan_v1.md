# Phased Development Plan

## Using SWAT Insights

Using the insights gained from the Software Assessment and Technical Recommendation (SWAT), here's a detailed roadmap for building out the AstraForge IDE extension.

### The Plan Emphasizes Modularity, Archiving, Testing, and Self-Improving AI Elements

* Total timeline: 4-6 weeks, assuming 20-30 hours/week.

## Development Roadmap with Milestones and Deadlines

### Phase 1: Foundation and Cleanup (Week 1)

* Stabilize structure and basics.
	+ Restructure: Move contents from temp_folder/ to root; archive empty dirs and redundancies (e.g., via Git commits noting archives).
	+ Setup CI/CD: Add GitHub Actions for linting/build (use rules' GitHub Flow).
	+ Update dependencies: Run npm update and audit; add ESLint/Jest.
* Milestone: Clean, committed repo with basic linting (End of Week 1).

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Enhancement (Weeks 2-3)

* Build AI/LLM features.
	+ Refactor code: Parallelize LLM calls; add real embeddings (e.g., integrate @huggingface/inference).
	+ Enhance workflows: Implement RL in rl/ for adaptive phasing (e.g., reward based on user feedback).
	+ Add features: Server-side socket.io for real-time collaboration; multi-agent isolation.
* Milestone: Functional MVP with end-to-end idea-to-deployment (End of Week 3).

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (Week 4)

* Ensure quality.
	+ Write tests: Unit/integration for all managers; aim for 85% coverage.
	+ Document: Create README.md, ADRs; archive old versions.
	+ Security scan: Use npm audit and add key encryption.
* Milestone: 85% test coverage, full docs (End of Week 4).

### Phase 4: Deployment and Iteration (Weeks 5-6)

* Release and improve.
	+ Bundle extension: Use vsce for VSIX packaging.
	+ Deploy: Publish to VS Code Marketplace; setup feedback loop for self-improvement (e.g., log user interactions to refine LLMs).
	+ Iterate: Based on bonuses like WebSockets; archive experiments.
* Milestone: Released extension with CI/CD pipeline (End of Week 6).

## Recommendations for Tooling, Libraries, or Frameworks

* Tooling: VS Code extensions (ESLint, Jest Runner); GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
* Libraries: @huggingface/inference for embeddings; jest for testing; dotenv for secure configs.
* Frameworks: LangChain for advanced LLM chaining; Docker for deployment simulations.

## Plan for Continuous Integration, Testing, and Deployment (CI/CD)

### CI

* GitHub Actions workflow on push/PR: Run lint, tests, coverage checks. Fail on <85% coverage or vulnerabilities.

### Testing

* Automated Jest runs; manual reviews for AI outputs.
* Archive failed test artifacts.

### CD

* Auto-publish to Marketplace on tagged releases. Use semantic versioning; generate changelogs noting archives.

### Monitoring

* Post-deployment, track usage via logs; use RL to auto-optimize (e.g., adjust panel sizes based on performance).
