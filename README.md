## Overview

AstraForge IDE is a revolutionary VS Code extension that transforms project
ideas into fully functional applications using multi-agent LLM collaboration,
vector-based context retrieval, and automated workflow management. Built with
visionary AI principles, it embodies the future of autonomous development.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented Features

- **Multi-LLM Panel**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI (Grok), and OpenRouter
  with modular provider architecture
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean provider interface for easy addition of new
  LLM APIs
- **Request Caching**: LLM response caching with TTL and throttling to optimize
  performance
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent LLM requests with configurable limits
  using Promise.all
- **Input Security**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all
  user inputs
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimized VS Code extension activation with on-demand module
  loading
- **Git Integration**: Basic automated commits and version control
- **Workflow Foundation**: Phase-based development structure (Planning â†’
  Prototyping â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment)
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with .env
  support
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configuration with TypeScript best
  practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and
  deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.80.0 or higher
- Node.js 18.x or 20.x
- Git configured in your system

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/AstraForge.git
   cd AstraForge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension**:

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

4. **Load in VS Code**:
   - Press `F5` to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window
   - Or install the `.vsix` package from releases

### Configuration

1. **Setup Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys
   ```

2. **Setup LLM Panel**:
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Run "AstraForge: Setup LLM Panel"
   - Configure 3-5 LLMs with your API keys from different providers for optimal
     collaboration

3. **Configure Performance Settings**:
   ```bash
   # In your .env file
   MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=3
   ENABLE_REQUEST_CACHING=true
   CACHE_TTL=3600
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Idea Submission**: Describe your project in natural language
2. **LLM Conference**: Multiple AI agents discuss and refine the concept
3. **Phased Execution**: Automated development through structured phases
4. **User Oversight**: Review and approve suggestions at key decision points
5. **Continuous Improvement**: System learns and optimizes from feedback

### Advanced Features

- **Custom Refinements**: Provide specific instructions for complex requirements
- **Innovation Suggestions**: AI proposes cutting-edge enhancements
- **Vector Context**: Intelligent retrieval of relevant project information
- **Archive Management**: Automatic cleanup and organization of project
  artifacts

### Line endings

This repository enforces consistent line endings via `.gitattributes`. Most text files use LF; Windows scripts use CRLF.

```gitattributes
* text=auto eol=lf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.sh text eol=lf
```
